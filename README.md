## Current Status

The project has evolved into a comprehensive React application featuring:

### 🚀 **Current Main Feature: React Router Implementation**

- Complete SPA (Single Page Application) with multiple routes
- Navigation bar with active routing between pages
- 404 error handling for undefined routes
- Styled components with individual CSS files

### 🔥 **Advanced Features Implemented:**

- **Context API**: Global state management without prop drilling
- **useReducer Hook**: Complex state logic handling
- **useLayoutEffect Hook**: **NEW!** Synchronous DOM mutations and timing comparison
- **API Integration**: GitHub API data fetching with loading states
- **Conditional Rendering**: Multiple return patterns based on state
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling

### 🆕 **Latest Addition: useLayoutEffect Implementation**

**File:** `Uselayoutexample.js`

This new component demonstrates the crucial difference between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`:

- **useLayoutEffect**: Executes synchronously before DOM paint
- **useEffect**: Executes asynchronously after DOM paint
- **Console Output**: Shows execution order to understand timing differences

**Key Learning Points:**

- When to use `useLayoutEffect` for DOM measurements
- Performance considerations between the two hooks
- Visual differences in execution timing
- Best practices for choosing the right hook

### 📝 **Component Highlights:**

- **MultipleReturn Component**: Demonstrates async data fetching from GitHub API
- **Context API Chain**: Shows data flow through A_ContextAPI → B_ContextAPI → C_ContextAPI
- **useReducer Examples**: Both tutorial and practical implementation
- **useLayoutEffect Demo**: **NEW!** Compares execution timing between useEffect and useLayoutEffect
- **Styled Pages**: Each route has its own styled component

## Getting Started & Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
