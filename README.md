# React Learning Project - 30 Days Web Development Journey

This is a React learning project created as part of a 30-day web development journey. The project demonstrates various React concepts and hooks through practical examples.

## Project Overview

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and contains multiple React components showcasing different concepts:

### Components Built

1. **UseEffect Component** (`useEffect.js`) - Currently Active

   - Demonstrates the `useEffect` hook with state dependencies
   - Features three interactive buttons that update state
   - Shows how `useEffect` responds to state changes
   - Displays clicked values dynamically

2. **Incrementor Component** (`Incrementor.js`)

   - Simple counter application using `useState` hook
   - Increment and decrement functionality
   - Demonstrates basic state management

3. **Form Component** (`From.js`)

   - Basic form with input fields (name, email, password)
   - Event handling with form inputs
   - Shows form interaction patterns

4. **Data Component** (`Data.js`)
   - Works with JSON data (`datas.json`)
   - Demonstrates data mapping and rendering
   - Uses `useState` to manage data state

### Key React Concepts Covered

- ✅ React Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`)
- ✅ Component State Management
- ✅ Event Handling
- ✅ Conditional Rendering
- ✅ Data Mapping and JSON Integration
- ✅ Component Import/Export

### Project Structure

```
src/
├── App.js          # Main App component
├── index.js        # Entry point
├── useEffect.js    # UseEffect demo (currently active)
├── Incrementor.js  # Counter component
├── From.js         # Form component
├── Data.js         # Data rendering component
└── datas.json      # Sample JSON data
```

## Current Status

The project is currently showcasing the **UseEffect Component** which demonstrates:

- Interactive buttons that update component state
- `useEffect` hook monitoring state changes
- Console logging of state updates
- Dynamic content rendering based on user interaction

## Getting Started & Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Learning Progress

This project is part of a structured learning approach to React development. Each component demonstrates specific React patterns and best practices:

- **Day 1-3**: Basic component creation and JSX
- **Day 4-7**: State management with `useState`
- **Day 8-10**: Side effects and lifecycle with `useEffect`
- **Day 11-14**: Form handling and user input
- **Day 15-20**: Data fetching and JSON integration

## Next Steps

Future enhancements planned:

- [ ] Add more complex state management
- [ ] Implement API data fetching
- [ ] Add routing between components
- [ ] Style components with CSS/styled-components
- [ ] Add form validation
- [ ] Implement local storage
